# BlockPlayersOnSteam

Block players from a list on steam, using selenium. Not well made, not done...yeah.

You can only use this with chrome because it's the most commonly used browser and I made it for that browser in mind




# How does one use this?

# using BlockPlayersOnSteamv1.zip


Step 1.
you'll need these.

- da file (ofc)
  
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/dr/download/?brand=CHBD&ds_kid=43700075934933222&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA2oW-BhC2ARIsADSIAWqqpE1Fb-gC79dgdWsxYgvFG_fC9AI4WKiuUcRJO_7aq9OMrHauoWMaAiTSEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
Step 2.

update usernames.txt (located in BlockPlayersOnSteam\V1.0\_internal) to include links to the users you wanna block each on seperate lines. (use the pfps in the text file as reference.)

Step 3. 
Check the console, it'll tell you what to do.

# From .py file

### Step 2. make sure you CLOSE chrome before running the script, it will fail if chrome is open
Step 3. 
update usernames.txt to include links to the users you wanna block each on seperate lines. (use the pfps in the text file as reference.)

Step 4. run main.py with python (double click the script)

Step 5. login, it'll try and find your chrome userdata but if it fails it'll let you know if it fails by sending you to the login page.

Step 6. Watch as it blocks users in ur txt file REALLLY fast
